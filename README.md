# 📚 Unsupervised Author Text Analysis

This project applies a variety of unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster book chapters written by four English-language authors. The goal is to uncover structure in the data and identify meaningful patterns in word usage without using author labels during training.

## 🧠 Problem Overview

The dataset consists of word count vectors from book chapters by four authors. Common stop words are treated as features. The problem is tackled through several stages:

1. **Visual Representation of Data**
2. **Clustering and Comparison of Algorithms**
3. **Pattern Recognition**
4. **Model Validation and Stability Analysis**

## 🔧 Techniques Used

### 🔹 Dimensionality Reduction

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
- Spectral Embedding
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
- Biclustering

### 🔹 Clustering Algorithms
